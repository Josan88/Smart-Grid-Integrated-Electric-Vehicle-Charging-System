# Smart Grid-Integrated Electric Vehicle Charging System

## Project Overview

The Smart Grid-Integrated Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging System is a simulation dashboard designed to model, visualize, and manage the complexities of an EV charging infrastructure that interacts w[...]

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Simulation Control:**
    *   Start, stop, and control the speed of simulations.
    *   Set specific start dates and times for simulation runs to model different conditions.
*   **Real-time Data Visualization:**
    *   Interactive charts displaying key performance indicators:
        *   **PV Output:** Monitors power generated from photovoltaic (solar) sources.
        *   **Battery Status:** Tracks the state of charge (SoC) and recharge rate of energy storage systems.
        *   **EV Charging:** Shows the recharge rate for EVs and the battery levels of individual vehicles connected to charging bays.
        *   **Grid Interaction:** Visualizes power requested from or supplied to the main grid.
*   **Configurable Simulation Parameters:**
    *   Adjust a wide range of parameters influencing energy flow, charging bay allocation strategies, battery management logic, and more.
*   **PVWatts Integration:**
    *   Allows users to input or update PVWatts settings, enabling the simulation to incorporate realistic solar energy generation data.
*   **Comprehensive Data Logging & Export:**
    *   Logs significant simulation events and data points.
    *   Provides functionality to export detailed simulation data to CSV files for further analysis.
*   **Interactive User Interface:**
    *   A web-based dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    *   Utilizes Socket.IO for seamless real-time communication between the frontend and backend.
    *   Features intuitive controls such as buttons, forms, dropdown menus, and sliders for user interaction.
*   **Modular Backend System:**
    *   The backend is primarily developed in Python, managing the core simulation logic, data processing, and communication with the user interface.
    *   Includes MATLAB components (e.g., `sim_the_model.m`) for specific modeling or simulation tasks, indicating a hybrid approach to the simulation engine.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    *   **Charting Library:** (Likely Chart.js or a similar library, based on common web practices)
    *   **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO
*   **Backend:** Python, MATLAB
*   **Data Exchange Format:** JSON (for API communication), CSV (for data export)

## Getting Started
